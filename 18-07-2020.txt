Shell: 
? It is the outer layer of UNIX operating System. 
? It reads our command, verify syntax and check whether the corresponding command related application is available or not. 
? If everything is proper, then shell interprets our command into kernal understandable form and handover to the kernal. 
? Shell acts as interface between user and kernal.

Kernal: 
? It is the core component of UNIX operating system. 
? It is responsible to execute our commands.
? It is responsible to interact with hardware components. 
? Memory allocation and processor allocation will takes care by kernal.

Flow of Execution
1) User types the command in the terminal. touch durga.txt 
2) Shell reads that command. It will check whether that command is valid or not and whether it is used properly or not. If everything is proper, then shell interprets/translates that command into kernal understandable form.
3) Shell handovers that interpreted command to the kernal. 
4) Kernal executes that command and perform required activity.
5) Once command execution completed, then shell returns unix prompt ($ OR # OR %). 
6) $ OR # OR % represents it is ready for the next command.
